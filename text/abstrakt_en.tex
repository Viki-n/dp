In this thesis we compared some variants of binary search trees that approach dynamic optimality: Tango trees, Multisplay trees, and Splay trees. We empirically tested the behavior of these three types of trees, as well as Red-Black trees. We measured the amount of visited nodes per operation and running time on real hardware. 
We proved that Tango trees and Multisplay trees are in most cases less efficient than Splay trees and Red-Black trees. Cache-related effects played a surprisingly large part in the behavior of Red-Black tree and Splay tree.
